# Python Modules Study

Just learning how modules and packages work in Python.  
This folder has a few small files made to try things out:

- password_generator.py — random password generator.  
- temperature_converter.py — Celsius/Fahrenheit converter. 
- date_time_study.py — prints current date with time.
- main.py - testing ground file.
